# Idento

Idento wants to be a complete, manageable OpenID Connect server for adding Single Sign On (SSO) functionality to your projects. It is based on the IdentityServer4 and ASP.NET Identity but adds a user-interface for managing certificates, apps, external login providers (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Outlook, Google, etc), users, roles and claims.

Idento will also include user self-service where users can manage their credentials, applications and link/unlink their external logins.
